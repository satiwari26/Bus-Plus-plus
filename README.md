# Vehicle related problems that we have in SLO
1. Cars emit significant amounts of carbon, contributing to the overall increase in carbon emissions in the environment. In addition, the large number of cars on the road leads to traffic congestion, causing longer commute times and hindering productivity. Moreover, cars take up a significant amount of space on roads, parking lots, and garages, which could be used for other purposes.

2. The limited use of public transportation leads to limited funding, which in turn results in limited bus routes and reduced service to many areas. This can make it difficult for individuals who depend on public transportation to get around and can also contribute to increased traffic congestion.

3. Buses often make unnecessary stops, which can lead to longer commute times and waste valuable time for passengers. Additionally, buses may stop at locations that are empty, rather than adjusting their route to account for changing passenger demand. This can result in inefficiencies in the transportation system and decreased satisfaction for riders.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
