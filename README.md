# Vehicle related problems that we have in SLO
1. Cars emit significant amounts of carbon, contributing to the overall increase in carbon emissions in the environment. In addition, the large number of cars on the road leads to traffic congestion, causing longer commute times and hindering productivity. Moreover, cars take up a significant amount of space on roads, parking lots, and garages, which could be used for other purposes.

2. The limited use of public transportation leads to limited funding, which in turn results in limited bus routes and reduced service to many areas. This can make it difficult for individuals who depend on public transportation to get around and can also contribute to increased traffic congestion.

3. Buses often make unnecessary stops, which can lead to longer commute times and waste valuable time for passengers. Additionally, buses may stop at locations that are empty, rather than adjusting their route to account for changing passenger demand. This can result in inefficiencies in the transportation system and decreased satisfaction for riders.

## A quick Comparison

From Cal Poly's campus to Target on '1190 LOS OSOS Valley Rd,
1. Car takes about 9 mins to get there.
2. With bike it roughly takes about 15 mins to get there.
3. With Transit it takes about 30 mins to get there. 

### Solution
1. Increase use of mass transit and other public transportation alternatives.
2. Introduce a bus-on-demand system for faster, more efficient bus rides.
3. Induce demand for public transportation with a value-add incentive program.

### Market Viability
1. Growing market indicates sufficient interest and demand
2. Robustness of program is evidenced in its survival of the pandemic, with a smaller percent reduction in use than traditional transport solutions.
3. Bus+ has additional incentive program to further encourage use.

### Competetion
Carpooling with Uber and Lyft
1. Capacity is limited.
2. Pricing is subjected to demand and highly variable.
3. Lack of incentive program means no ancillary benifits to local community.

## Application layout
1. A complete modern UI with easy access to each components.
2. Some components such as book your ride and Points accumulated have been prioritized and need further devlopment along with the backend.
3. Only front-end has been designed so far with React frame-work to improve the UI and UX.
